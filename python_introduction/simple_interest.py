# Define principal amount, interest rate, and time
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05  # 5% interest rate as a decimal
time = 3

# Calculate simple interest (I = P * R * T)
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest in a user-friendly format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest:.2f}")  # Format to display two decimal places
